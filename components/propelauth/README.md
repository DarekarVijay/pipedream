# Overview

Using the PropelAuth API, you can build a wide variety of authentication options for your applications or websites. No matter your needs, the API lets you quickly and easily incorporate secure authentication into your project, allowing you to protect user data and keep your system secure. Here are some examples of the types of authentication you can build with the PropelAuth API:

1. Password-based authentication - Create custom login forms and securely store hashed passwords in your system.
2. Social logins - Enable your users to sign in via popular social network accounts like Facebook, Twitter, and more.
3. OAuth authentication - Allow users to securely log in with identity providers like Google, Microsoft, and more.
4. Multi-factor authentication - Implement additional layers of security, such as SMS verification, biometric authentication, and more.
5. Access control - Create custom policies to control user access to specific resources and services.
6. Self-service password reset - Allow users to securely reset their passwords without jeopardizing the security of your system.
